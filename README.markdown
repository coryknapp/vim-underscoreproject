# vim-underscoreproject

Automaticly searchs all parent folders for a file called `_proj.vim` and
`source`s it.

## Requirements

We use python, but I don't think you need vim with python, as the python calls
are done through a vim `system(...)` call.

I've tested this on Mac OS X and MacVim, but it should work on pretty much
everything.

## Contributing

I'm very open to contributions, suggestions, and criticisms.  Like everyone, I'm
still learning VimScript.
